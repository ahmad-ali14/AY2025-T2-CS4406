## Notes

- The repository is organized into directories, one for each unit.
- The repository will be deleted after the course ends.
- We will be using the latest version of Three.js for the assignments `v0.170`.
- The assignments base is broken because of the new version of Three.js, so I will update the base code to work
  with the new version.
